The Employee Management System is a React.js–based web application developed to efficiently manage employee records and organizational operations. 
The system allows administrators to maintain employee profiles, track attendance in real time, and perform automated salary calculations based on attendance data.
A responsive dashboard provides a centralized view of employee information, attendance status, and payroll details.
The application also supports PDF report generation, enabling administrators to generate and download monthly salary slips and employee reports.
By automating attendance tracking and payroll calculations, the system reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and improves accuracy and efficiency in human resource management.
